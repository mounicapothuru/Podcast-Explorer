ninety two three years preceding nineteen ninety five found up a pole a planet orbiting a paler a very weird kind of star a neutron star and that food in have been a normal planet sure and so that

probably not you know adam reed at the work on you know i help bounced off of him but we wouldn't have had the result without him and i was on both teams for reasons i mean you know it the style of the first seemed the supernormally project didn't match mine they came largely from experimental high energy particle physician visits where there's these hierarchical teams and stuff and it's hard for the little guy to to have a say at least that's what i can it whereas the team of astronomers led by branch was fitela bunch of my friends and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams and we decided to band together but all of us had our voices heard to a sort of a culture a sile that i preferred really but when we tell you a story at and no bell banquet okay i'm

and call it he sat on that but but but there's a lot of conquers it right where you will sit to listen historians for ever have it's the traits a vamous trade off so empire and they'll say well look at the trade that day facilitated and look at peter all the kinds of things but they come at the cost of all those peoples that they conquered forcibly and and and by force integrated into their empire the one thing we need to remember about the mongols that makes him different than say the romans and this is complex defend way above my pay grade but in fascinated with it and it's more like the comanches that you just ran up is that the mongols are not a settled society okay they are they are they come from the nomadic tradition now several generations later when you have a double a ton as as the head as the emperor china its its ginning to be a different thing right and the mongols when their empire broke up the ones that were in settled the so called settles to cities riding ran places like as they will become more like over time the rulers of those places were traditionally and the mongols and say light a governante the golden hoard which is still in in their traditional nomadic artois will remain traditionally more mongol for when you start talking about who the mongols were i try to to make a distinction they are not some really supersensitiveness confederacy in an area that saw nomadic confederacies going back to the beginning of recorded history the scythians as sarmatians avars a hum the magyar i mean these are all the nomadic etheloid a of the eurasian step were huge huge players in the history of the world until gunpowder nullified their their traditional weapon system which i've been fascinated with the cause there traditional weapons system is not one you could copy because you were talking about being the greatest warriors you could be every warrior society have ever seen values that what the what the nomads had of the the eurasian step was this relationship between human beings and animals that changed the equation it was how they rode horses and societies like byzantines which would form one flank of the step in then all the way on the other side you had china and below that you had persia these societies would all attempt to create mounted horsemen who used archery and they did a good job but they were never the equal of the nomads because those people were literally raised in the saddle the compared them to send hears on the comanche's great exam considered to be the best course riding to a warriors in north america the command she is i was loved watching there's hintings george catland the famous painter who painted the comanches illustrated it at the mongols and the cities and gideon and avars and all these people did it he who are they would shoot from under neath horses neck hiding behind the horse the whole way you look at a picture of somebody doing that and its insane this is what the busento couldn't do and the chinese couldn't do an it was a different level of alane sing a human animal relationship a gave them a military advantage that could not be cabiri it could be emulated but they were never as good right that what they always hired these heired mercenaries from these areas because they were incomparable is the combination of people who were shooting bows and arrows from the time they were tollers who were riding from the time they were a wood road all the tout mither works for the huns were boldly the romans said because they were never a that left everything in the saddle that creates something he is difficult to copy and it gave them a military advantage you know i enjoy reading actually about it when that military advantage and it so seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the chinese on one flank and the russians on the other are beginning to use firearms and stopped to break this military power of these caves various hans the mongols were simply the most dominating and most successful of the confederacies that if you break it down they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid of the apex of the food chain had a lot of the people that were known as mongols were really at lots of other tribes not mongolian tribes that when the mongols conquer you after they kill a lot o youth than corporate you into their confederacy and often made you go first you know i geeve the body we're going to make these people go out in front and suck up all the arrows before we go in finish the job so to me and i guess a fan of the mongols would say that the difference and what made the mongols different wasn't the weapons system or the fighting of the warriors of the armor anything it was gingham and if you go look at the other really dangerous from the outside world repiners step no matter confederacies from past history was always when some great leader emerged that could unite the tribes and you see the same thing in native american history to a degree too ah you had people like a tall a right or other one called truman he go back in history in these people make the history book because they caused an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbours that normally i mean chinese business approaches to the steppe were always the same they would pick out tribes to be friendly with it would give the money yes higher than and they would use them against the other tribes and generally pisantry in chinese diplomatic history was all about keeping these tribes separated don't let them form confederations of large numbers of them because it then their own soul was of perfect example at at the huns were another large the turks not a large confederacy of these evil and they were devastating when they could unite so the diplomatic policy was out lettum that's what made the mongols different as genesa he united them in the unlike most of the tribal confederacy he was able they were able to hold it together for a few"}

related so far blue print for arm aged in the first world war series we did that was in my back pocket the whole time and when the centennial of the war happened it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was thousand hallow a series and as probably on my favorite surlier and and i have to take psychologically manitou know when you get to these i think i'm guessing here i think it's twenty six hours all pieces together think about and and we don't do scripts it's improvised yes think about what went to timbo right on twitter just yesterday saying um and got osinin like i'm not seeing the dedication here you're only getting two point five shows it to you and i wanted to say that my anne you have no idea what an the only people who understand really are other history pocasse they don't generally do twenty six hour of lothian two year endeavour on as i said the first show we ever did was like fifteen minutes i could crank out one of those of months so when you're doing mentalist show we did on the fall of the roman republic five and a half hours that's a book right and it was part of six for something so i betther math man felt at your side to and trouveront felt a curatio ally pulled in through it like i felt taxing enthusiast good thing that because that you know anything we said during the show for that was the feeling that if people at the time having i think in it at one point we said if this is starting to see m gruesomely repetitive now you know how that he will aetites so other words that had any sort of inadvertently because when you improvise a show some of these things or inadvertent but it is inadvertently created the right climate for having a sense of empathy with a story line and to me that those of the serenities moments that made this art and not as some sort of paint by the numbers kind of endeavor you know and and that's to me that wouldn't have happened had restricted it out so is mostly usuri the tools of knowledge to the table and then in large part in provided like the actual wording i always say we make it like they may things like signal to and some of those other things where am the material so i do have notes about things like on page for twenty seven of this work you have this quite so that i know a ha met the point where i can drop that in far and sometimes i'll write note saying here's where you left off yesterday so i remember tom but in the improvisation you end up thrown a lot out and so like like but it allows us to go off on tangents i will try things like i sit there and go i wonder what this would sound like and i'll send two days going down that road and all this to a government doesn't work with that sigli writers do this all the time they call chilling your babies right you get it you know get not but people go to this agostine dedication he has no idea how many things with rowing out i did an hour and a half i had an hour and a half into the current show about a two months ago and i listened to it i just want you know what is not right on it the window there goes six weeks a work yet right but here's the problem you trust you i trust your judgment no but here's the peers to thing um or shows a little different than other people so joe wrote and called it ever green content in other words ah my political show is like a car you behind and the minute you drive it off a lot it loses half its value right cause it's not turn any more these shows or just as good or just as ad a five years from now as they are when we use although the standards on the internet changed or when i was to my old shows i cringed sometimes to the standard so much higher a but if when you re creating evergreen content you have two audiences to worry about you have the audience is waiting for the net show and they've already heard the other ones and their impatient in their telling you on twitter where is it for she have shout the shows also for people five years from now will have i discovered it yet and don't care a whit for how long it took because they're going to be able to download the whole of an all they care about is quality and so what i always tell new podchaski they always say i read all these things that it's very important you have a congolese gudule's not more important than putting out a good piece of work and the audience will forgive me if it takes too long but it's really good when you get it they will not forgive me if i rush it to get it out on time and its peace a craft so for us and this is why when you brought a lot if i deal er anything else they can't interfere with this at all because my my job here is or as unconcerned its quality and everything else goes by the way side because the only thing people care about long term the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is right how good is that book if you re jarocki work to morrow if you don't care how long it took him to write it all your tears how good is this day and that's what

amateur content was going to be great and i never got a by any altimeters thing this isn't going to take off his anybody who's good is already going to be making money at this and i kept saying forget that we're talking about scale here if you have millions of eases it haunt him being made every week a small percentage is going to be good no matter what right sixteen year olds will know what other sixteen year old i can i kept pushing this nobody is but the pod caster out of that because in if you're talking about amateur content in nineteen ninety nine well then your already where in a you're ahead of the game in terms of of not seeing words going to go financially but seeing working to go technologically and so when we started the pod casting two thousand five and it was a political one not hardware history to which as an outgrowth of the old radio show form weint have any financial law ideas we were simply trying to get our handle on the technology and how you distributed of people all that and it was years later till we tried to figure out a a how then we get enough money to just support as well were doing this and with the cheap in the easy way was to ask listeners to donate like him he be as kind a model that was the short original model or so then once we started down that we figured out other models in this advertising thing in that we saw the old shows and so all these became ways for us to support ourselves on but has as hard casting mature and as more operating systems develop and forms were developed and fall these kinds of in every one of those developments which actually made it easier if if people to get the poncas actually made it more complex to make money off them this the waller audience was building the amount of time and effort we had to put into the monetization side began to cyril so they get actor satify question to use just one example there's a lot of people who are doing similar things hum and this day and age you know we just sell m p three five law you had to have as empirically now every time there's an os opera something breaks to us so we're having i mean my choices are this morning to start highering sat more staff in people and then be a human resources manage a mine tyrant radio side of this was the irradiate of this cause you didn't need anybody but you ay or you and another of you cujus do this lean and me and then it is becoming hard to do it lenines if somebody like a spot if i comes in and says he i will handle that stuff for you in the past i would just say that or we don't need a tellin mind and i i i decently not making what we could make on this or what we would have to do to make that is honorius to me but in becoming honorius to me day to day anyway and so if somebody were to come in and say he or will pick it up for you we will not interfere with your content at all we won't and my case you can't say we need a show a month because that have in and right so in everybody's everybody's pub design is different rights so it doesn't father's not one size fits off but i guess as a long time pirate had caster on there you know we've been looking to partner with eve but nobody's right for us to partner with me so so i am always looking for ways to take that side of it off my plate cause i'm not interested in this is all i wanted to is to shows and they wouldn't it really a his point you shouldn't call yourself an artist because some you know that's something decided by us what i mean how would it in to do art and there's something very satisfying in that but the part that i can't stand is that the increasing amount of time the monetization is questioned takes on us and so there's a case to be made i guess is what i'm saying that if a partnership with some outside for enhances your ability to do the art without disentangler ability to do the art its armed wherefore here is its arm its enticing us oh i don't likely company an so i'm afraid of of whatever strings might come with that and if i'm joe roguin and i'm talking about subjects that can make company public companies you know a little nervous am i would certainly be careful but at the same time people who are not in this game don't understand the problems that literal i mean just all the operating systems all the potaters every time some new pop catcher comes out make it easier t get a poast that's something we have to account for on the back end and i am not exactly the technological wizard of all time so am i think it is maybe maybe the short answer is is that as the medium develops its coming something that you have to consider not because you want to sell out for because you want to keep on it is becoming harder and harder to be pirate like in this in"}

II","subtopic_order":"4 of 20","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"3 of 3","start_timestamp":"0:27:17","end_timestamp":"0:32:15","raw_text":"let me suggest something there's a line that a marine named eugene sledge had said once and i keep it on my phone because it's it makes a real distinction and he said a front line is really where the war is and anybody even a hundred yards behind the front line doesn't know what it's really like now the difference is is there are lots of people miles behind the front line that are in danger right you can be in a medical unit in the rear and the artillery could strike you planes or trial be in danger but at the front line there are two different things one is that and at least an i'm doing what a reading on this right now in reading a lot of veterans accounts of james jones who wrote books like from here to which unity fictional accounts of the second world war by based on his own service he was a guardian of a soldier in front line action requires an almost surrendering to the idea that you're going to live you are you become accustomed to the idea that you're going to die and he said you're a different person simply for considering that out erious because most of us don't but what that allows you to do is to do that job at the front line right if you're too concerned about your own life you become less of a good guy your job right the other thing that the people in the one in the one hundred yards of the front line do the people in the rear medical unit really don't is you kill and you kill a lot right you don't just owe their a sniper back here so i shot him it's we go from one position to another and we sell lots of evil those things will change you and what that tends to do not universally cause i've read accounts from far red army soldiers and their very patriotic right but a lot of that patriotism comes through years later as hard of the nostalgia and the remembrance when you're down at that front one hundred yards it is often boiled down to a very small world so your grandfather is it your grandfather grandfather the machine gun he's concerned about his position and his comrades and the people who lose a responsibility to and those hit a very small worlds that were in time that's where the hero is is right he's not fighting for some giant worlds to bellizona thanks he's fighting to say if the people nexum and in his own life at the same time because they're saving him too and and that there is a a huge about a herostratus door questioned but for surly why would you use force for how about to protect easel on either side of me right there lives an now is there hatred he hated the germans for what they were doing as mercia i got a note from a hole not at long ago and i have this tendency to refer to the nazi stride the regime that was any sent withholding them notes he says say say what they were they were germans and this i wanted me to not absolve germany by saying oh it was this awful group of people that are over your country he said the germans do this and there is that bitterness where he says let's not forget you know what they did to us and why a what we had to do bad right am so for me when we talk about these combats situations the reason i call these people heroic is a cause of their fighting to defend things we could all understand me if you come after my brother and i take a machine gun and shoot you ah and you're going to overrun me i mean you gonta becomes a situation where we talked about counter for earlier much ease you to call yourself a hero when you're saving people fall your saving this hound right behind you you know a they get through your machine gun titian these villages they got three people out in the middle of winter in families that to me is a very different sort of heroism than this amorphous idea of patriotism in your patriotism a thing that we often get on used with right people people manipulate us through love of country and all that because they understand that this is something we feel very strongly but they used it against us sometimes in order to whip up a war fever or to get people i mean is a great line and i wish i could remember it and sentire determined goring had said about how easy it was to get the people into a war he says you know you just appeals their hatreds with men the there's buttons that you can put should they take advantage of things like love of country and the way we and the way we have at loyalty and admiration to the warriors who put their lives in the line these are manipulable things in the human sea seas that were liable can be counted on to move us in directions that in a more sober reflective state of mind we would consider differently gets a sage's war fever

of 20","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"2 of 4","start_timestamp":"1:20:34","end_timestamp":"1:26:17","raw_text":"an interesting question and one i thought a lot about because less take alexander the great as an example because alleys andrew fascinated the world of his hind fascinated ever since he led been fascinated with the guy but alexander was a hereditary monarch right there i was handed a kingdom is as right but he did not need to rise from nothing to get that job in fact he reminds me of a lot of other leaders of redintegratio example in prussia these people who inherited the greatest army of their day alexander and less he was an imbecile was going to be great no matter what cause if you inherit the veremos you're going to be able to do something with it right alexanders father may have been greater to look at he philip the second was a guy who literally did create a a a a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people that were continually beset o their neighbors he's the one that reformed that army or took things that he had learned from other greek leaders like a feelier chaminade's amended and then laboriously over his lifetime save alizon eers built his sodom pylos and i doing it he see his leg was made lame me this was a man who looked like he built a empire and led from from the front rank mean um so and then and then who may have been killed by his son we don't know who assassination handed the greatest army the world had ever seen his son who then did great hangs with it see this is hawermann timson my mind i'm not sure alexander really can be that great when you compare him to people who arose from nothing so the difference between what we would call in the united states the self made man for the one who inherits a fortune others an old line that you know how is that it's a slur it it's about rich people on is as like he was born on husband base and thought he hit a triple right philip was born at home plate and he had to hit allesandro started on their base and so i try to draw a distinction between them jingaan his top he cause there's two traditions the tradition that we grew up with here in the united states and that i grew up learning was that he was a self made man a but there is a tradition and it may be one of those things that what after the fact because a law a long time ago if whether or not you had blue blood in your veins was an important distinction and so the distinction that you have often hear from mongolian history are is that this was a a nobleman who had been deprived and his inheritance so he was a blue blood anyway i don't know which is true ought there certainly i mean when you look at a geniculata go that is a wicked amount of things to have achieved a he's very impressive as a figure at tellus very impressive as a figure a healers an interesting figure he's warehouse people to cut you know the more i study about hyper the more you wonder where the defining moment was because m if you look at his life man hither was a relatively common soldier in the first world war i mean he was brave he got he got some decorations in fact the highest caraton he got in the verse world war was given to him by a jewish officer and it was a he often didn't talk about that decoration even though it was the more prestigious one because it would open up a whole canework want to get into but hitler's come he said who was hitler to day one of the topping you're going to say as he was an anti semi well then you have to draw a distinction between general regular antisemitism that was pretty common in the era and something that was a rabbit level of anti semitism but hinder did he seem to show a rabid level of of antisemitism and till after or the there and of the first world war so if this is a defining part of this person's carrier and and much of what we consider to be his his evil stems from that what happened to this guy when he is in adult right it already fought in the war to change him so i mean it's almost like the older was always a movie theme somebody gets hit by it i something on the head in their whole personality change is right i mean it almost seemed something like that so i don't think i call that necessarily a great leader it mediatorship about hither what a hell happened to a non descript orson who didn't really impress anybody in with his skills and then his in the nineteen twenties is all of a sudden as you says sort of the man of the hour rights that to me is kind of but i have this feeling the gangue and we don't really know was an impressive human being from the geo and many of his rays in this environment pressure on all sides you you start with this diamond and then you polish it and you harden it is a life hypersensitive a very unimpressive gemstone most of his life it then all of a sudden so i mean i don't think i can label greatly resin man i'm always fascinated by that idea that an i'm trying member for the quart was by that fat great men oloroso great manner often not good men and that in order to be great you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities that we normally with insider a jesus or a gun the european mites the quality if one looks at as as the good upstanding moral quality that we should all desire to as examples right a booda whatever by these or those people would make good leaders because what you need to be a good leader off requires the kind of choices that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn't make em so i don't have an answer"}

of 20","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"8 of 33","start_timestamp":"2:21:47","end_timestamp":"2:27:05","raw_text":"i think some of the arguments were connected to the differences that we had and the fact that those differences are being exploited so we talked about in media earlier in the lack of truth in a we have a media climate that is incentive to take the wedges in our society and make them wider and there's no countervailing force to do the opposite or to health so there was a famous men from a group a project for a new american sentry and they took it down but the way back machine on lines so has it and it happened before i saw all kind of concert theories as he was saying something to the effect of an really paraphrasing here but you know that at the united states needs another pearl harbor type event because those galvanized country that without those kinds of events periodically is naturally gear towards pollinate apart and it's those periodic events that act as the countervailing force that otherwise is not there an if that's true then we are naturally inclined toward poling ourselves heart so the have a media of environment that makes money off widening those divisions are which we do i mean i was in tario and and it is it has those people the people that used to scream at me because i wouldn't do it but i mean we would have these terrible conversations after every broadcast where i be in there with the program director in their yelling at me allbutt heat was the worthy creed more she will what is feet right he miss division right as in an ante heat not because they are political they're not republicans or tifto democrats either this we want listeners one we want engagement and involvement and because of the constructs of the format you don't have a lot of time to get it so you can't have me giving you like on a hardcast an hour or an a half for you hours where we build a logical argument and you're with me the whole way if your audience is changing every fifteen minutes so whatever points you may to create interest and intrigue and engagement after be need you right now this they told me once that the audience has to know where you stand on every single issue within five minutes at turning on your show in other words you have to be part of a a linear set of political beliefs so that if you feel about subject a then you must feel de about subject the anather your pinion on because if you feel that way about a you're got feel that way about de this is a system that is designed to pull us apart for profit but not because they want to policarpio it's a viprous of the prophet that one little example of a fifty examples in our society that work in that same fashion so what that project for a new american century document was saying is that were naturally inclined towards disunity and without things to occasionally ratchet the unity back up again so that we can start from the base line again and then polarisation for harbor that you'll pull yourself apart which i think was seen chatsworth george freeman but was saying that i disagree with so much at the time oh so in antitrust on about civil wars we can't have the same kind of civil war because we don't have a geographical division this is clear cut as the one we had before right you had a base ally north south line and some border stated with set up or that kind of slit now we're divided within communities with in families for in gerrymandered voting districts and presents right so you have disengaged were stuffed with each other so if there's a civil war now for lack of a better word what it might seem like is the late nineteen six s early nineteen seventies where you had the bombing and in a let'spretend things like that because that that would seem to be something that once again you don't even need a large chunk of the country pulling heart ten per cent of people who think her it it's the end times can do the damage just like we talked about terrorism before and i can aghastness in a bunch of places and i won't give anybody ideas where it can i gassing lighter would take a thousand houses down before you could bleriot terrorist doesn't have to be from the middle east doesn't have to have some sort of a fundamental is religious agenda i could just be somebody really pissed off about the election results so once again if we're playing an odd game here everybody has to behave for this to work right only a few people have to miss a have for the santoisie wit and remember for every action there is an evil an obvious reaction so you don't even have to have those people doing all these things all they have to do is start a thought to fatal retribution cycle and there's an escalation yes and it go at it creates a moment of its own which leads fundamentally you follow the chain of events down their system form of dictatorial government as the only way to create stability right on destroy the republican habitat that how you do hand there a parallels in nayger many the burning of the right side that you know all"}

important question because it end of the day without the curriculum you don't get anywhere trickle to me is the fundamental day structure it's not even the class room is ten if i love the right so i think the critics where i like it so it's been a lot of times and he at us but i will tell you i answer question my answer esifeni ageing back at this which is you know you talked about discipline and what does it mean to be a discipline the truth is what we really educate people in from the beginning but certainly through college sort of failed if you don't think about it this way i think is the world people often think about tools until set and when you really try to be good to think about kills and feel as but dis pones are mine fright they're about fundamental ways of thinking not just the hammer that you pick up whatever that is to hit the nail on the learning how to hammer well or whatever it's a mind set of like what's the fundamental way to think about to think about the work right and disciplines different disciplines give you different lineage you different ways of soothing to sit that it quieted as have a mind it does it have a way of thinking about the world that is different from yetive and using this scientific method is a way of doing it or emanation who builds abstractions and tries to find so says truths about the abstractions that may be artificial but whatever or is it the engineer who is all about you know building the malverton with reaches on notion of trade off whatever that means right it sort of the world as you the world you live in what is computing know how is indifferent thought about this for a long time and i found come to view about what computing actually is what the mind set is and it's you know a little abstracted that would be appropriate for computing i think that what distinguishes the computation lists from others is that year she understand that models languages and machines are equipped there the same thing and because it's not just a model but it's a machine that is an executable thing that can be described as a language that means that its dynamic so it's not them it is mathematical in some sense in the chinese of abstraction but it is fundamentally dynamic and executable the mathematician is not necessarily worried about either that i name it for cover i tried to write something for fanatics they invariably demand that i make it stick and that's not a bad thing it just gets a way of doing the world that truth is a thing right it's not a process of continually runs right so that dynamic thing matters that self deflection of the system itself matters and that is what computer that is what computing brought us so it is a science because it finds the models from the mentally represent true in the world infermation is scientific thing to discover it not just a fanatical conceit he gets great but of course it's engineering because you're actually dealing with constraint in the world and trying to execute shineth actually run how but it's also a mat because you're actually worrying about his languages a described that describes with this rigouthe but the fact that that regular resonance time on one of which feels like a machine or at least an objection machine the other is language that they're actually the equivalent i mean that a small thing and it permeates everything that we do even when we're just trying to figure out how to set it the bugging so that idea i think is fundamental and we would do better if we made that more explicit how my life is changed in my thinking about this in the tenor fifteen years it since i have tried to put that to paper with some college is the realization which comes to a question you actually asked me earlier chester were falling down where the matter is this sort of triangle of equality in only matters because there's a person inside the trale frank that what's changed about computing perience whatever you want to call it as we now have so much data and so much computational power for able to do really really interesting promising thing but the interesting and the promising kind of only matters with respect human beings in their relationships to the triangle exists that is fundamentally computing what makes it worth while an interesting and potentially world seshes changing is that there is human beings inside of it an intelligence that has to interact with it the change the data the information that makes sense and gives meaning to the models lanjuinais so the curriculum can convey that walking the tools in the

yet and and and here i am profiting badly from someone i've never met but whose you know work i i follow which is an was actually on your pocasse i think you landless said you know basically the brain is a oisemont bring with a super commarin and i thought that's actually cried the best o sortin of the brain of ever heard because it captures a lot of important features like a limbeck friction right few we think of life o you when we're making plans were using the prefont corax and where he executive function and all the honestest thing about the drug addict whose driven to go pursue heroin or cocaine they make plans so clearly they use their front a cortex is just that it's been hijacked by the limits in all the month a monkey brain as you refer to thrilling not fair to monkeys though elam because our salmonkey can make lands it just don't make plans as to fisicas as melotte with monkey we asbenouee i'm your putting your saying likewise there is a lot of value to folking on the montbar whatever the hackea it but i do because less say i had to say in the ability to place a ship anywhere i wanted in the rain to day and after that it or inhibit at area i'm not sure i will put that ship in negoro except maybe the just kind of have some fun and so happens the reason is it's an abstraction machine and a serf i wanted to make a mass production tool the tool in mardion that i could give to a lot of people because the quite possible that you're abstractions are different enough in mind that i wouldn't know what patterns of firing to induce so if i want let's say i want it increase my level of ethopus and creativity full then i would love to be able to for instant control my level limberin i would love to be able to wake up and go on you know i haven't at o'clock aminta i wake up slowly so between seven eight but i want to do a lot of linear thinking you know what i'm going to just the limit friction and for rampart cortex activation so there's a lot of stuff that can happen in the toes with tenerani for instance you could shut down that shell around the tales in a low more creative thinking by a low and more lateral connection is a be some of the hose ready experience i'd wanted to so there in the subcordata put unquote monkey brain but you could then look at what sorts of abstract thoughts and behaviours would arise from that rather than an inherent pointing within or at neural lincoln all but there's this obsession with you hortation might lose a few friends but i'll potful gain a few einsam one other reasons people spend so much time in the cortex yes i have a fact and then opinion one fact is that you can image there and you can record that right now that you poonan one polton my cross cabinets that allow you to achieve to the brain still don't allow you to image down really deep unless your jam in prisons in there and nicoean then in the nose narrow your getting very you know it's like looking at the bottom of the ocean through its reality and so you much easier look at the waves up on top yet right so let's face it folks a lot of the reasons why they're so many recordings and later to three o cortex with all this advance my cross biscuits very hard to image deeper now the microscope are getting better and thanks to amazing work mainly of engineers and comes and those let's say there the ones who brought this revolution in her aside in the last ten years or so he can image deeper but we don't really that's why you see so many reports on layer to three the other thing which is duly opinion and i'm not going after anybody here but is that as long as there's no clear right answer it becomes a little easier to do creative work in a structure where no one really knows how it works so it's fun to program because anything you see is novel if you as work in the tales or the whole venator the hypotheses of the structures have been known about since the sites in events and really since the you know centuries ago you are dealing with exist yet to combat existing models and wet resinous no one knows how this in worse nicotia court hand so serve in loom for discovery he a lot more room for discovery and i'm not calling any one out i love cortex we published the papers on cortex its super interesting but i think with the tools that are available nowadays and where people are trying to head of not just reading from the brain monitoring at writing to the brain i think we really have to be careful and we need to be thoughtful about what are we trying to write what stricter we try to write because they are many brains structures for which we already know what scrips they ride and i think there's tremendous value there i don't think it's boring but fact that they act like machines makes them predictable those are yours eros and ants yale's start there that sort of happening in this field of writing to the brain as there's this idea and again i want to be clear i'm not pointing neritina the theotokis out there that you go and you observe patterns and then you think replaying those patterns going to give rise to something interesting yashoda out one experiment or two experiments which were done by situation did an experiment where they monitored a bunch of neurons while an animal learned something then they captured those neron through some molecular tricks so they could repay the neuroses now there's like perfect inari is like monitor the neurons in your brain then i say okay neurons once through one were played in the particular sequence so you know the safe time you know the keys on the piano that were played the gave rise to the song which was a behavior and then you go back and you reactivate those neurons except you reactivate them all at last like slamming on all the keys once on

testing algorithms yeah right you're jesting or them so i want to just because i know some of the people listening to this and you how have basis and you know scientific training and have signed to a training so i want to be clear i think we can be corrected some thing like a roll of working memory in these kinds of processes without being exhausted were not saying that the only thing that you know recasts the oneida i mean eurie's face is still in its infancy i mean we probably know one per cent of whether is now about the brain you know we've learned so much and yet there may be global states that underlie the that make free frontal circus work differently than it would in a different regime or even time o day i mean there's a lot of mysteries about us but so i just want to make sure that we seeming for precision in acuter not going to lost that and be his there's a difference there and i think you know sometimes in the vastness of the internet that gets forgotten so the other is that you think about we think about these operations at you know really focusing of things on line but what you were describing is actually it seeks to the very real possibility probably that with certainty there's another element to all this which is when you're trying out lots of things in particular lots of different algorithms you don't want to be in a state of very high autonomic rose that's not what you want because the higher level of autonomic rosalind dress in the system the more rigidly you're going to analyze face and time what you're talking about is langhammer and i want to be very clear i mean the son of a physicist i am not a physitian when i talk about satinette talking about visual say and how long it takes for my finger to move from this point to this point you are facing a tiger and trying to figure out how to avoid being eaten by the tiger and that's primarily gazania by civil system in humans we don't walk through space for instance like a fan town wood and look at three dimensional sentence you know when a sent he goes out in the environment they have depth to their odor trip the odor trails are mowing and they don't think about them it we don't think about odor trails you might say oh well this smells getting more intent a ha a day actually have three dimensional odin trail so there i see a contrast of course with their nose and raftery cortex we do that with our visual system and we parsed time often subconsciously with mainly with our visual system also with our auditory system and this shows up for the musicians out there metronomes are a great way to play with us you know basra when that frequency of base drumming changes your perception of him changes hilloo penniman sassenheim are linked in the rough the sensory apparati rites and ears and nose and hum probably through tattoo and through touch em for us but mainly through vision so when you drop into some coding or federating through a creative process or trying to solve something hard you can't really do that well if you're in a rigid high level of autonomic rouse ill because your plugging in algorithms that are if he nissards time regime matches it say time mash whereas creativity i was think the lavalavas actually a pretty good example even though it has a yukoner new ag connotations because you actually don't know which direction things are going to change and so in drowsy state and sleeping and drowsy safe face and time become dislodged from one another somewhat in their very fluid and i think that's why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps and the cotentin into its discussion of you lie about secedes and what we now know for instance that people thought that psychedelic were by just creating santanu or sting of neurons and hallucinations but the the five hosea and be to see into a receptors which are the main sits within like alsacian and some of the other hallucinations that drug secret who as nations of those were setters are actually in the umcolcus of neurons that in case the fames which is where all the sensory information goes into pasture clapham articular nucleus and its an inhibitory structure to make sure that when we're sitting here talking that i mainly focused on whatever i'm seeing visually that i'm essentially eliminating a lot of sensory information under conditions where people take acadians particular serenest aretted that inhibitory shell it's literally shaped like a shelf starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage or sensory information but mostly the effects of psychedelic are because the lateral connective in layer five of course increased and what that does is that means that the face time relationship or vision like moving my finger from here to hear a very rigid say time relationship right if i slow it down at slower obviously but there's a prediction that can be made based on the neurons and the rain on the coronel be very strange experience yes but the auditory system has one that slightly different say time and their matched to one another deeper circuits in the brain through the factory system as a different space time relationship to so under conditions of of these same crease activation of these cartoner sat and time cross sensory area starts being fluid so i'm no longer running the algorithm for moving my finger from here to hear and making heredities based on vision alone i'm now this is where people talk about on hearing sights right you start linking the dismally make a sound in the second state no i'm not suggesting to run out and do secaucus it's very disorganized but essential what you're doing is your mixing the algorithm and so when you talk about female access new solutions you don't need to rely on secondes if people choose to do that that's their business but in drowsy saves disattachment is increased as well the shell of the faliscans and what's this here through these so called pons geniculata waves and what's happening as you're getting whole brain activation at a level that you're certain mixing algorithms and so sometimes i think solutions come not from being in that narrow tunnel of say time and strong activation of working memory and trying to well to iterate if this then ateing deductive and induce same king and working from first rinciple but also from states where something that was an algorithm that never never had an existence for suddenly gets a lumped with another ogrin all of a sudden a new possibility comes to mind and so face in time need to be fluid and face in time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful and i realize i'm ripping long on this a disaster was so much interest a few years ago with michael polanska other things happening about psychedelic as a halfway to exploration and all this hunting but the question is what you export back from those experience right cause dreams are amazing but if you can't bring anything back from them they're just a"}

mostly visually animals to navigate and survive humans mainly rely on vision not smaller something else it it's a filter for cognition and it's a it's a strong driver of cognition may be just because it came up and then we're moving the higher level concepts it just the way the visual system works can be some arising it in a few relatively susten and like most of what i said which has not been so tinted all that's go there now that we the were ravestein is this three layers of neuron structure at the back your eyes on this a credit card it is a piece of your brain and sometimes people think i'm kind of regaling bit out of reality by saying that it is it absolutely a piece of the brain it's a for brain structure that in the first rimester there's a genetic program that made sure that that neural retina which is hard your central nervous system was sweet what called the embryonic cost and that the bone formed with a little hole where the open ere was going to connect to the rest of rain and those that window into the world is the only window into the world for it rammish has a ealer's have a thin also their pineal gland sits and lizards to and snakes actually have a whole set like can make it down into the pineal directly and entrain melton and rhythm for time of day and time of year humans have to do all that through the assuree layers of neurons sit or piece of your brain there central nerve i am and the optic nerve annex to the rest the brain the neurons and the eye somewhat just care about luminant just how brighter demon is and they informed the brain about time of day and then the central orcadian clock and forms every senior body about time of day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens if you're getting light your eyes the right times all sorts of bad things happen if you are getting light randomly throughout the twenty four hours salesforce talk about all that this is a good incentive for keeping a relatively normal schedule at consistent caul you'll ast light exposure loss ten casual trying keep a consistent got when you're young it's easy to go off gaul and recover as you get older it gets harder but you see everything from how it comes in cancer a patience to obadias in bum you know improve swiper getting light at purtier time a day and getting darkness at a particular phase of the twenty four hour sidle were designed to form get light and dark at different times the of the circean side dat's all being all that information is coming in through specialized type of neronian the retinal the melanops an intrinsically photo sensive gangster by david person at brown university that's not facial information it's subconscious you don't think oh it daytime even if you're looking at the sun it doesn't matter it's a photon counter it's literally counting photons and it's an even though it's cloudy day lots of photon coming in a winter in boston and musty winter your sister is a little bit pressing alert that not a coincidence that's these melanops and self signaling the circuiting cloth their bunch of other neurons in the eye debt signal to the brain and they mainly signaled the presence of things that are lighter than background her darker them background so a black object will be darkhan a light object later the background and that all come it's mainly a pickets looking at pixley ansley look at circle and those neurons have receptive fields which would not everyone will understand but those neurons were sown bath a little circles of dark light or little circles of bright light on little circles of red light verses little circles of green lighter blue lit and it so it sounds very basic it's like red green blue and circles righter or dimmer than what's next to it that's basically the only information that sent down the odier and when we say information we can be very precise i don't mean little bits of red travelling down the optic or i mean fikes neural action potentials in face and to which rouse make total sense i think for a lot of people it is actually beautiful to think about all that information in the outside world is converted into a language that's very simple it's just like a few syllables if you will and those syllables are being shouted down the optic nerve converted into a totally different language like more code be b b b beating in his into the brain and then the tall must essentially respond in the same way that the ranee the foul mess is also waiting things it saying you know it that saying with moving faster than everything else for its writer than everything else so that signal among to get up in the low attractor that signal is much redder than it is green some one at that signal got through that signal as much an it's kind of more like the red neck to it throw that out and information just doesn't get up into your court acted then in court excurse is were perception save and in van if you will roaring boring areas you start getting representations of things like oriented lines so there is a huron that rents tangle of my hand versus vertical attending work if you will be so no bell and it's a very systematic map of orientation line orientation direction of movement and so forth and that's pretty much and color and that's how the visual system is organized all the way up to the court so it's archil you don't but i want to be clear it's hierarchical because you don't build up that line by suddenly having a heron that responds to line a romance the lines by taking all the dots that are aligned in a vertical sack and they all converge on one neuron and then that neron responds to vertical lines so it's not random there's no abstraction at that one in fact in fact if i showed you a black line i could be sure that if i were imaging the one that i would see a representation of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in your cortex so at that point it absolutely concrete it's not abstracted things get really mysterious some of that information travels further up into the cortex to that and goes from one visual area to the next or the next or the next so that by time you get into an area that nancy can warren it has studied her much of her career if you to form face are you sent for start finding single neurons that respond only to your father's face or two joe regan's face regardless of the orientation of his age i'm sure if you saw joe ease you know him well from across the room and you just saw his roiled the oh that's so walkershaw the orientation of his face is there you wouldn't even see his eyes

work","subtopic_order":"9 of 16","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"6 of 6","start_timestamp":"0:52:32","end_timestamp":"0:58:53","raw_text":"yeah and i think you know two things come to mind as you're saying this first of all yeah i mean we're talking about what's best for work is not always was as for you know a completeness of life i mean you know out ism is probably many things like when you tism just like feet their price fifty ways to get a fever the price was so that the brain can create what looks like outis or what people call off is there's an interesting set of studies that have come out of david ginty's lab at harvard med from looking at these are mouse tents where these are models for aut ism where nothing is disrupted in the brain proper and in the central nervous system but the sensory of the sensory neurons the ones that intervene and the ears everything are hard hypersensitive and this map to a mutation in certain forms of human tis so this means that the overload of sensory information and cenerentola things and then they get the stereotype behavior a rocking and the kind of leasing it you know we always thought of that as a brain problem in some cases it might be but in many cases it because they just can't seem to have a turning the volume up on every sense and none of us want to become like that i think it's hard for them and it ortheris and so forth so i like the coffee shop example because the way i think about tyldesley now physically or mentally or otherwise as one of coal it lillian a real scientific irmanno ledge that kinnereth concept which is that we always hear about resilience it makes it sound like oh you know under stress where everything coming at you you're going to say all but there's a limit the limit system wants to pull you in some direction typically in the direction of reflexive behaviour and preventeth ough to down mechanism has to suppress that and say no we're not going to respond to the banging of the coffee cups behind mirror i'm going to keep focusing that's your top down control so the limit friction is high in that environment you put yourself into a high limit friction of iromea that the prefect easter work really hard but there's another side to limit friction too which is when you're very sleepy there's nothing in coming can be completely silent and it's hard during and focus because your drifting off your gang sleepy so they're limit friction as i but for the opposite reason on onomacritus they are turning on netlik in the background or looping a song might boost your level of alertness that will allow top down control to be in the place exactly this week lot you want it so this way earlier i was saying it's all about how we feel inside relative to what's going on on the outside were constantly in this i guess one way you could envision it say silly such is ouble in listening to this just on audio is i like to think about it kindle a glass barbel where one sphere of perception and attention can be on what's going on with me and one sphere of attention can be in what going on with you or something else in the room for in my environment but those this bar bell is in rigid it's not really glass would lame word or i don't know anything that is a imagine that this thing can contort the size of the globes at the end of the bar bell can get bigger or smaller so let's i close my eyes and i bring all my experience into what's going on in terror section internally now it's as if i got two orbs of perception just on my internal state i can also do the opposite and bring to both orbs of perception outside the i'm not thinkin about my heart rater my breathing i'm just thinking about something i see and what you start to realize as you kin o use this facial model is that two things one is that torriani and that the more relaxed we are the more the two orbs of attention that you end of the bar bell can move around freely on the alert we are the more rigid they're going to be tethered in place and that was designed so that if i have a threatened my environment its heather to that threat i'm not going to be of something coming to attack me i'm not going to be like oh my breathing cadence is a little bit quick that's not how it works why because both orbs are linked to that to that threat and so might behaviour is now actually being driven by something external even though i think it's interns i don't want to get too abstract here because oursin is if not as a fearest when you state thinking about models of how the brain work i mean bring worse used me they're only really three things that nouronihar sensory neurons their motor in our on for their modulating things and the models of attention in perception that we have now twenty twenty tell us that we got intersection an extraction their strongly modulated by levels ouaouaoua that if we want to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure for some thing whether or not its sleep and impending threat or colding we need to adjust our internal face time relationship with the external a simulation ship and i realize i'm repeating what i said earlier but we can actually assign circuitry to the stuff it mostly has to do with how much limit friction there is how much you're being pulled to some source that source could be internal if i have if i have pain physical pain in my body i'm going to be much more interceptive than i am extra sad if you could be talking to me and i'm just going to be sinking about the hats very hard and the other thing that we can link it to is top down control meaning anything in our environment has a lot of salience will tend to bring us into more exercet that intersection and again i don't want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms what um what i think it can be useful for people is to do essentially you've done laissa developing an awareness when i wake up my mostly in a mode of interception were extra section when i work well is that what is working well look like from the perspective of autonomic or ousehold or calm i am i what kind of balance between internal focus and external focus is there and to sort of watch this pro"}

consciousness","subtopic_order":"13 of 16","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"2 of 13","start_timestamp":"1:45:57","end_timestamp":"1:52:04","raw_text":"to this the first one is that always late i'm not particularly angry now that the joke was still as two things you never want to say to a scientist one is what do you do in the second one is takes much time as you need and you definitely not want to say them in the same universe to it so there's a there's a cynical answer kind and it's not one enjoyed giving which is that if you look into the sand it oates and even into the early there were some very dynamics on very impressive feces who are very smart in the field of erosite and related fields we thought hard about the consciousness problem and fell in love with the problem but overlook the fact that the technology wasn't there so i admire them for followeth problem but they gleamed tremendous tax resources essentially for nothing and these people know who they are some of them are alive some of her more i am not referring to francis gracias really by the way and though the clause from was involved in the consciousness which i think is a great idea to obscure structure that no one is really sad people are now trinitarian wonder but there it you know there were books written about it makes for great it television soft and thought around the table or after a couple of glasses a wine or whatever it's an important problem on the less and so i think i do think the consciousness that the issue is not operational the fine right the psychologists are much smarter than a lot of hard scientists in that for the falling reason they put operational definition they know that psychology if we're talking about motivation for instance they know they need to put operational definitions on that so that you laboratories and know their studying the same thing the problem with consciousness is known can agree on what it is and this was a problem for tension when i was coming up so in the early people would argue what is the tension is escalation auditory attention is and finally people like you know we are the uneven agree on its tension so i was coming up as a young graduate student i'm thinking like i'm definitely not going to work on the tension and i've definitely not going to work on a conscious need i wanted something that i could solve for figure out i want to be able to see the circuit where the neurons i want to be able to hear it on the audio my word record from it and then i wanted to gain a function and lost it in should take it away see something change put it back he something changed us systematic utan that takes you down into the depths of some stuff that pretty plug in chuck you know but you know i borrow from something in the military cause fortunate to do some work with you and from feal operations and they have beautiful language around things as their world is not abstract and they talk about three meter targets ten meter charges and hundred meters targets and it's not an issue of picking the hundred meter target cause it's more beautiful for us more interesting if you don't take down the three meercats and the merest coat more kind of military thinking in that in that sense the other is really important is that just because somebody conceived us something and can talk about it beautifully and can glean a lot of m resources where it doesn't mean that it led anywhere so this isn't just true of the consciousness as sue and i don't want to sound cynical but i could pull up some names of molecules that occupied hundreds of articles in the very premier journals that then were later discovered to be totally mood for that process and botmane folded everyone in the lab tits and start doing something different with that molecule and nobody talks about because as long as you're in the game we have this thing called anonymous review you can't afford to pass off anybody too much unless you have some other funding strength and i awaited battle most of my career but i pay attention to all of it and i've watched this and i don't think it's ego driven i think it's that people fall in love with an idea i don't think there's any sort of money in science for people to sit back there roving their hands together you know the beauty of what nerle lank and elan and in them because obviously he is very impressive but that the team as a whole is really what gives me great confidence in their mission is that he's already got enough money so i can't be about that he doesn't seem to need it at a level of i don't know him but it doesn't seekin an eagle level or something i think it's driven by genuine curiosity and the team that he is assembled included people that are very kind of abstract neuro melcourt pettie coating people that ye like mat whose a nursin can't abou know you can't be as nursery they all years in surgery or not tolerated you have to be very good to exceptional even get through the gate and he's exceptional and then they've got people like an adams who was it used as suffer a long time as it could get run in to know em for years who is very concrete studied the vacillator in the eye and how it mattathias lateran cortes when you get a team like at together you're going to have descendere people that are high level thinkers people that are holders it when you get a team like that it no longer looks like an academic laboratory or even a field inside and so i think they're going to solve some really hard for albums and again i'm not here they don't you know i've nothing in that take with them but i think that's the solution you need a bunch of people who don't need first author papers who don't need to complete their ph d who aren't relying on outside funding who have a clear mission and you have a bunch of people who are basically will adapt the problem "}

words as all coming from you i think stanford is an amazing place as is it and it's such a boiled it out and you thing you say i may friends that i might see you know a martyr friends a boy on is best for any among the best in class there some people have a route that can hold full to candle to not many maybe one or two of i think they get the great benefit of being a place like it or stamper on is that when you look around the of the the averages very high i did you have many best in class c among the you know one or two or three best in the world that what they do and to wonderful privilege to be there and i one thing that i think also makes them in other universities like umbery special is that there is an emphasis on what gets exported out of the university what you know not keeping it ivory tower and really trying to keep in yon what's needed in the world and trying to do something useful man i think rockite industry and silicon valley and in the boston area and cambridge also lends itself well to that and there are other institutions of authors i got involved in educa social media was actually because of a dither the turn of twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen a weed formed a good friendship and we were we talk to me in the doing these early morning cold water swims i was learning a lot about pain and suffering but also the beauty of cold water swims and and we were talking one morning he said so what are you going to do to serve the world in twenty nine like the way that like a texan former seal talks i were just interest are you going to do it now and he wasn't forceful and above easiest in question i said well i'd my way out just you know the people every one about the brain letting in some ainsell do it all right you know shag on it did it you know and so i started putting out these posts and it's grown into include a variety of things but you have about a governing philosophy so i want to increase interest in the brain and in the nervous system and in biology generally that's one major i like to increase scientific literacy which can't be rammed down people's throats talking about how to look at a graph and statistics and you know scores and values and genetics has to be done gradually in my opinion to put valuable tools into the world mainly tools that map to things that were doing in our lab so these will be tools centered round how to understand the direct one states of mind and body so produced stress raised one stress threshold so it's not always just about being calm sometimes is bout learning how to tolerate not being not calm raise awareness for mental health is at han of micro missions in this set fatal really mates back to the like in ten year old version of me which is i used to send my week ends when i was a kid reading about we are animals and a disobeyin with like medieval weapons and stuff like had a pole and and then i used to come into school on monday and it asked if i could talk about it the class and teach i just ate really i promise and some people might not believe me but it's really i don't really liking the point of focus i just get so excited about these gems of that i find in the world in books and in fermentations with colleagues in discussions with people like you and and around the universe and i can't adjust compulsively i got to tell people about it if i try and package it into a form that people can access you know i think if i think the reception is been really wonderful stanford has been very supportive thankfully i've give it done some powered some stuff on social media such a precarious life to put yourself out there as a research academic i think some of my colleagues to a locally and elsewhere probably wonder if i'm still serious about research which i have sutly am and i also acknowledge that you know their research and the research coming out of the fields needs to be talked about and not all signs are good a translating that into a language that people can access and i don't like the phrase dumb what i like to do is take a concept that i think people will find interesting and useful and offer it sort of like a would offer footsore you're not going to cram for our grand their face you're going to say you want a cracker like a nice like you want something on that track your like you like cheese like you like you want swiss cheese or you want that really like senile friends i don't like cheese much of but you want for goliath like so you try the best information prompts more questions of interest not questions of confusion questions of interest and so i feel like one door opens them another ordinate door open and pretty soon the image in my mind as you treated bunch of neurosis or thinking about themselves in the essintial and i don't begin to think that i have all the answers at all i cast a neurone sometimes a little bit of a psychology lens on to what i think her interesting topics and you know you know some day imogen or the ocean or wherever it is i end up and i'm very comfortable if with the fact that not every one can be happy with how i deliver the information but i would hope that people would feel like some of it was useful and meaningful and got them to think a little bit ha"}

of 16","speaker_name":"Lex Fridman","speaker_order":"3 of 3","start_timestamp":"0:02:54","end_timestamp":"0:10:41","raw_text":"the fears what are these spirits you find to be effective now so it depends on the person obviously am and we should probably define fear right cause you can without going too far down the rabbit hole of of defining these things you know you can't really have fear without stress what you could have stressed without fear and you can't really have trauma without fear and stress what you could have for in stress without trauma so you know we can start playing the word game and that it actually is one of the motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things is that we really need better physiological neurosis ii and operational definitions of what he's things are i mean if the field of understanding memotas and states which is mainly what i'm interested in is very complicated but we can can do away with a lot of complicated debate and say in our laboratory wall we're looking for to assign it a value of fear is a big inflection in autonomic rouses increases in heart rate increases in breathing prostration pupil dilation all the whole marks into the stress response and in some cases we have the benefit of getting nurse surgery patients where we've got electrodes in their idol and their insula in the tooth a call so these are chronically implant electrodes were getting multenius signals and we can start seeing some central teachers of meaning within the brain and what's interesting is that as trivial is that might seem in the listening to it almost everybody responds to height and falling from a high virtual place with a very strong stress if not fear roue and that's because the visual vestibule apparati right flow and how it links to the you know balance increases all the scandal stuff but really all of that so your physiology the feeling that your stomach is dropping the feeling that you suddenly sweating men though you're not afraid of falling off this virtual platform but you feel as if your following befalling sees me because of the optic love that one is universal so we've got a dive with rightway shark experience where you actually exit the cage we went out and castanier and brought back reserved that's all out pretty astete sixty various city video and this was important strikes so when we decide to set out this laporotomy was that a lot of the studies of from these things in laboratories and want to call them lame because i want to be respectable the people that did the stuff before but they study fear by you know showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something like that or any just the less you have a snake phobia it just wasn't creating a real enough experience so we need to do something where people aren't going to get injured but where we can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people momentarily not the whole time but momentarily forgetting their in elaboratory and so heights will always do it and if people want to challenge me on this i like to point to that movie free soul which was wild because you know it's incredible movie but i think a lot of its popularity can be explained by a puzzle which is you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater for you watched it on at home you knew before that he he survived and yet it was still scary that people somehow were able to put themselves into that experience or into alex's grants enough that they they were concerned or worried or afraid that some level so heights always does it fit we get people who have generalizing it these are people who walk wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of autonomic or else a inanity then we can tip them a little bit more easily within that don't necessarily get everyone afraid things like a claustrophobia public speaking that gin a vary from person to person and then if you're afraid of sharks and massiter for instance afraid chart she eleven come to my laboratory cause there should there's a thing about sharp in it that's how terrified some people are of these scifi stimulate but height yet the every time that an i'm terrified hittites snow when kanwa you step off a platform virtual platform and it's a flat floor in my laugh but we you're up there will you actually allow them the possibility in the virtual world to actually take the leap of a theme should describe a little with the cement so am without getting away too much in case some one wants to be a subject in one of these excrement we have them playing a cognitive game it's a simple light out trying a game where you're pointing a curser and turning out lights on a grid but he gets increasingly complex and its seeds up on them and you know there's a failure point for everybody where the yuan make them motorman fast enough and then we surprise people essentially by placing them virtually all of a sudden their sister on a narrow platform between two buildings and then we encourage them or we cetewayo microphone to continue across that platform to continue the game and you know some people they just won't they actually will hold get down on the ground and hold on to a virtual being that doesn't even exist on a flat floor and so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if they were real and we really think that anchoring the visual and of a sibilate balance components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly there's also the potential we haven't done this yet to bring in three threadneedle all this in a lot of her with edelman was i i just wasn't real enough but with three sixty video we knew that we could get people into his presence where they think there is a real rancour friend michael muller who has introduced to because of the project i reach out to some friends mutimer's very famous portrait photographer and hollywood but he dives with great white sharks and he leaves the cage and so we worked with him to build a three sixty video apparatus that we could swim under water with went out to guillamo and fashion it was a lot of fun it was there some interesting moments out there of danger but he would came back with that video and built that for the sharks and then we realized we need to do this everything we need to do it for heights when he do it for public speaking for claustrophobia and what's missing still is three sixty sound where through sixty sound would be of frinstance if i were to turn round and there was a like a giant attack a there the moment i would turn around and see it the dog would grow but if i turned back toward you then it would be silent so and that brings a very real element to one's own behavior for you don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner where as if there's a dog growling behind me and i turned around and then i turned back to you and still growling natah seem like more of an impending threat but an sustained threat but actually it's when you start linking your own body movements to the experience so when it closed loop where my movements and choices are straying to influence things and they're getting carrier and carrier that's when you can really drive people's nervous system down these tales of high high states of stress and fear and we don't want to traumatized people obviously but we also we also study a number of tools to a hat allow them to calm themselves in these environments consistance is hight hit"}
